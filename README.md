# Paramdigma Workshops Poster Creator

This repo contains all files related to the poster creator for all of our workshops. It will be expanded in the future to also create IG/FB optimized images with the same appearance.

This works as any other jekyll page. It just uses a custom layout for the posters, which is located at `_layouts/poster-template.html`.

> If you find any problems, please open an issue.
