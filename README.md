# Paramdigma Workshops Poster Creator

This repo contains all files related to the poster creator for all of our workshops. It will be expanded in the future to also create IG/FB optimized images with the same appearance.

In order to run you will need to have installed:

- GNUMake
- Pandoc

There are already 2 tasks created for this project in the .vscode folder.

- `Build Posters` will build all html sites for the posters plus will regenerate the index.
- `Process SCSS` will build all styles related to the poster pages.
